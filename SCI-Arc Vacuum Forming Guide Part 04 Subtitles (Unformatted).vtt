00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:08.313
Before engaging with either of the vacuum formers, first check that you are equipped

2
00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:13.109
with the proper safety equipment: a functioning respirator and filters, and closed toe shoes

3
00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.694
are required, not optional.

4
00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:21.200
Whenever you enter the vacuum forming room, ensure that you securely close the room's

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.244
doors so that fumes do not escape.

6
00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:29.125
Make sure you turn on the lights located on the left-side wall,

7
00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.628
turn on the room ventilation located on the right-side wall,

8
00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:37.216
and the miniature vacuum former's power switch located on the left side of the machine

9
00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:40.762
as it takes several minutes to completely heat up for use.

10
00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:47.101
If you're using a release agent on your buck, such as talcum powder, do so now while the machine is heating up.

11
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:49.520
Be sparse in your release agent application.

12
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.903
When the machine has been heated for several minutes, you may now begin operating it.

13
00:00:56.903 --> 00:01:01.616
First, raise the bed of the vacuum former using the lever on the right-hand side of the machine

14
00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:05.328
as well as raise the frame clamp lid up using the small blue handles.

15
00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:10.625
With the lid upright, you'll want to slide in the metal frame crop that best fits the form size you're making.

16
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.171
Use the smallest frame crop that fits your buck so as to not waste unnecessary material.

17
00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:24.639
Once your proper frame crop is set, gently place your buck in the center of the bed.

18
00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:29.227
When you're done, lower the bed fully back down with your buck on it using the same lever.

19
00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:32.939
Next, slide your forming material over the opening and center it.

20
00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.485
Your material should be one inch larger in both length and width of the frame crop you're using.

21
00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:41.531
When ready, gently lower the frame clamp lid back down and tighten it with the two

22
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.908
clamps located on the same two handles.

23
00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:51.040
For most applications, it is recommended that you keep all of the machine's heating

24
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.668
control dials to their maximum strength.

25
00:01:53.668 --> 00:01:56.671
To the right of the heating controls is the heating timer.

26
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.674
20 seconds is a sufficient amount for most materials.

27
00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:07.515
When you're ready to form, slide the heating module completely forward using the large blue handle.

28
00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:12.395
The timer will begin counting down and the machine will beep when it reaches zero, though the machine's

29
00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:16.357
heating module never actually stops heating so stand nearby.

30
00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:20.027
You'll know your material is properly heated when it slightly sags.

31
00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:25.783
If your material is still too firm, slide the heating module back over and it will automatically continue heating.

32
00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:34.208
Once your material is sufficiently heated, immediately raise the bed completely and then flip the vacuum pump switch.

33
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:38.671
After several seconds, push down the release lever to help loosen the buck with air.

34
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.758
Now flip the vacuum pump switch back off and leave the form to sit undisturbed

35
00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:45.261
for roughly one minute to allow it to cool down.

36
00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:07.909
Once your form has cooled down, you may remove it from the machine and separate your components.

37
00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.372
Remember to be courteous and clean Remember to be courteous and clean put back any frame crops you used,

38
00:03:13.372 --> 00:03:16.918
lower the frame clamp lid, and return the bed to its lowered position.

39
00:03:54.789 --> 00:04:00.044
When you exit the vacuum forming room, don't forget to turn off the vacuum former, ventilation, and lights,

40
00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:03.256
and properly close the doors if no one is queued next.

41
00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:08.261
Congratulations, you now know how to properly, safely, and successfully vacuum form.

42
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.888
This concludes the SCI-Arc vacuum forming guide.
